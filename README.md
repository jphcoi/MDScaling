## MDScaling

A python module for the multi-dimensional scaling of networks. MDScaling takes topological data (a network of connected nodes) an produces a multi-dimensional embedding in a geometrical space where distance is related to topological similarity.

### Instalation

    pip install mdscaling

### Directed Bipartite Graphs

This is the module's main application. It allows for the embeddings/scaling of directed bipartite graphs, for a range of *methods*, a range of *parameters*, and the computation of comparison metrics for the *methods* x *parameters* space.
